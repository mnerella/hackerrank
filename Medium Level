1)Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

  'a'happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
  'b'happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).
  'c'happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).
  'd'happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points P1 and P2 and round it to a scale of 4 decimal places.

Note: Manhattan Distance is the distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. 
In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.


Input Format:

The STATION table is described as follows:

FIELD                Type
      id                 Number
      City               varchar 2(21)
      State              varchar 2 (2)
      LAT_N              Number 
      LONG_W             Number
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

SOLUTION
--------

                 /*select Round(abs(Min(LAT_N) - Max(LAT_N)) + ABS(MIN(LONG_W)-MAX(LONG_W)),4) 
                   FROM STATION
                   */
